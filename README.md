# PIC-Practices
Implementations for various tasks with PIC18F8722 based structure within the content of Ceng336-Introduction to Embedded Systems Development Course, written in both in assembly and C.

All tasks written are for PIC18F8722 based architecture with MPLAB X IDE.

## [PIC-IO](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/PIC-Practices/tree/master/hw1_PIC-IO)
A simple led task which aims to practice fundamental I/O functionalities of `ports` in PIC with buttons/leds, written in assembly.

## [SpaceImpact](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/SpaceImpact/tree/bfa3260b1f733a0d1c1d657eb5ec8f5445b9655e)
An Implementation for space impact game which aims to practice `Interrupt` and `Timer` functionalities of PIC, written in assembly. 

## [ElectroVote](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/PIC-Practices/tree/master/ElectroVote)
A simple voting simulation which aims to practice `Interrupt`, `Timer` and `ADC` module functionalities of PIC, written in C. In this task, `LCD` has also been used, an implementation for its driver has been provided.

## [RTOS](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/RTOS/tree/a1910d6830673b263d2b6eb48ff7d9d7349495cc)
A maze-runner-robot (:smile:) simulation/RTOS project which aims to practice necessities of Real-Time tasks, written in C with PicOS18 Kernel. `Alarm`, `Multitasking` and `Event` functionalities of RTOS has been utilized.
